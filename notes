//  // make sure to add: "start": "node index.js" and "type": "module"," in package.json
 
//  express () is an express object, which is stored in 'app'
//  make sure you give it to a port: const port = 4001, and connect the app to the port via app.listen(port)

// check that it works by using npm start which should return journal-api@1.00 etc
//app object has a method that corresponds to each http method (GET, POST, etc): e.g. app.get() which tells it to accept a get route. first parameter is a url
// rememeber we have two consoles: a server console, and a front end (react) console that will appear in the browser. Technically it will be two separate 'applications' that will communicate through a restful api.
// always put in req, res for app.get commands


//Mongodb Notes:
// when putting in documents into mongo, it must be an object, with key-value pairs. in turn, each object will be added under 'documnets'
// remember:
//db.categories
//db.getCollection('categories')
